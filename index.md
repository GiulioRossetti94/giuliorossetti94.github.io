# About me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher (Houlden Fellow) at the [University of Warwick -- Warwick Business School](http://wbs.ac.uk/).

I completed a PhD in Finance and Econometrics at the University of Warwick -- WBS in 2024, under the supervision of Professors [Cesare Robotti](https://cesarerobotti.com) and [Philippe Mueller](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/philippe-mueller/).

My research lies at the intersection of financial econometrics and asset pricing, with a particular focus on asset returns.
