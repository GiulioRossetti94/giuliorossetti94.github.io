# PyBondLab

I have worked with [Alex Dickerson](https://www.alexdickerson.com/home){:target="_blank"} to create **PyBondLab**, a Python package offering tools for empirical asset pricing research.

It is part of the [Open Source Bond Asset Pricing project](https://openbondassetpricing.com/){:target="_blank"}.
Check the github repo [HERE](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti94/PyBondLab){:target="_blank"} and examples [HERE](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti94/PyBondLab/tree/main/examples){:target="_blank"}.

You can install the latest release using pip
```bash
pip install PyBondLab
```

Or you can install the master branch from GitHub by cloning the repo and running setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GiulioRossetti94/PyBondLab.git
cd PyBondLab
python setup.py install
```
