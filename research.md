- **[Common Pitfalls in the Evaluation of Corporate Bond Strategies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4575879)** with [Alex Dickerson](https://www.alexdickerson.com/home) and [Cesare Robotti](https://cesarerobotti.com)
  
<sub>*`We argue that the documented large abnormal returns to investors from a wide array of corporate bond strategies mainly stem from ignoring market microstructure noise in transaction-based bond prices and relying on (ad hoc and asymmetric) out-of-sample return trimming or winsorization. To address these issues, we construct bond data that is largely free of microstructure noise and closely mimics industry-grade quote data. We revisit prior findings in the literature and provide conclusive evidence that most bond anomaly portfolios/factors, once properly constructed, generate negligible average returns and alphas. Finally, we show that the considered factors (and their underlying signals) are only weakly related to average bond returns.*</sub>
  
- **[On the statistical properties of tests of parameter restrictions in beta-pricing models with a large number of assets](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5112225)** with [Amedeo Andriollo](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/aandriollo/) and [Cesare Robotti](https://cesarerobotti.com)

<sub>*We study the size and power properties of t-tests of parameter restrictions for newly- designed methods that aim at reliably estimating risk premia in linear asset pricing models when the cross-sectional dimension is large. By simulating a variety of empirically calibrated data generating processes for sample sizes that are typically en- countered in empirical work, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the test statistics for scenarios where the factor structure is (i) strong and pervasive; (ii) spurious; (iii) weak/semi-strong and pervasive; (iv) weak/semi-strong and not pervasive; and (v) sparse. PCA-based methods such as those of Lettau and Pelger (2020), Giglio and Xiu (2021), and Giglio et al. (2022) work best when the factors are strong and pervasive, and they continue to exhibit good finite-sample properties when the factors are spurious. However, when the factor structure is semi-strong and pervasive, the split-sample estimator of Anatolyev and Mikusheva (2021) performs substantially better than the PCA-based estimators listed above. In the case of sparse loadings or when the factors are semi-strong and not pervasive, none of the candidate methods displays satisfactory finite-sample properties.*</sub>

- **Bond return predictability and anchoring bias**
  
<sub>*This paper investigates whether deviations of macroeconomic variables from their historical moving averages—capturing investors' anchoring biases—enhance the predictability of bond excess returns. Utilizing a large dataset of macroeconomic indicators and shrinkage methods, we construct a deviation index following the approach of Avramov et al. (2022) to evaluate predictive power against traditional yield-curve predictors. Although deviations from past macroeconomic values demonstrate substantial in-sample forecasting ability, particularly through sparse and principal component analysis, this success does not extend robustly out-of-sample. Our findings indicate that, despite strong theoretical motivation from behavioral finance literature, anchoring biases captured via deviations from historical averages provide limited practical improvement over standard predictors in forecasting bond risk premia.
